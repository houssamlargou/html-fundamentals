          Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging tool that enables
          people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use
          the resulting insights to improve decision making—and already it is
          transforming every walk of life. In this report, Darrell West and John
          Allen discuss AI’s application across a variety of sectors, address
          issues in its development, and offer recommendations for getting the
          most out of AI while still protecting important human values.

          <p class="ph-margin">
            AI allows computers to learn and solve problems almost like a
            person. AI systems are trained on huge amounts of information and
            learn to identify the patterns in it, in order carry out tasks such
            as having human-like conversation, or predicting a product an online
            shopper might buy.The technology is behind the voice-controlled
            virtual assistants Siri and Alexa, and helps Facebook and X -
            formerly known as Twitter- decide which social media posts to show
            users.

            Losey explores the intersection of human-robot interaction by
            developing learning and control algorithms that create intelligent,
            proactive, and adaptable robots that are taught to personalize their
            behavior, adapt to human needs, and proactively help users achieve
            their goals.

          To summarize, the world is on the cusp of revolutionizing many sectors
          through artificial intelligence and data analytics. There already are
          significant deployments in finance, national security, health care,
          criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities that have altered
          decisionmaking, business models, risk mitigation, and system
          performance. These developments are generating substantial economic
          and social benefits.
